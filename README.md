# Friday Night Funkin: VS. Puff Puff

# About the Mod
Woah look came out of the grave! Are you ready to face the lead singer of **"Your Favorite Martian?** Well, grab your asses because it's time to have a Martian Moment with Puff Puff Humbert, coming back with a remix of his songs!

Will you be able to fight him off this!?

# NOTE
This is a DEMO Version for the Mod. If you want to have this source code and play the game using that, you might need a lot of things to download on your computer. **(Hopefully it doesn't fuck up your storage or anything lmao.)** Here's the link for recompilation guide: https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin. Then again, if you're having a hard time, then just go through [here.](https://gamebanana.com/mods/220986)

But if you ever snoop into these files, you will notice that most of the assets were unchanged. Some of them were just into their respective folders but I'll be properly putting some assets in a new folder **in the final development of this mod** **(Maybe for avoid cluttering shit all over lol.)** But the code does change a lot based on what I just knew.

Hello! Thanks for trying out this mod! Please take note that you are playing the **DEMO Version of VS. Puff Puff** which only includes **ONE SONG** for now. Please understand that **this mod was made only by two people**, especially the programmer who is **still a beginner at implementing some codes needed for sprites, effects, etc.** Some stuff/charts in each difficulty **may subject to change in the final development.**

We hope you understand us, thank you! **Few advices for coding could help for the programmer to learn and test this mod!**
